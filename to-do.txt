Theme: Encourage more developers to write more tests by further simplifying JUnit

Before first public candidate release:
!* update documentation
    * update the FAQ (pending)
!* add  javadoc to API interfaces and Annotations

Before final JUnit 4 release:
* Make JUnitCore pluggable
* contact all test runner authors
		make sure TestListener is symmetric and meets needs of all runner developers
* Ant
  * Basic task
  * Compatibility with existing formatters
* support testing run once initialization code e.g. class Foo {{...}}
* enable tighter and more flexible IDE integration
	* be able to specify the order of tests
		enable test reordering/prioritization
			run failures first (<- this seems like it is up to the runner)
	* test categorization & filtering (<- seems like a runner issue) @Category(short, integration)  @Test(category=windowsOnly)
* get 100% coverage
* logging support (runner listeners should handle this?) (Log4JListener , 1.4 logging support (java.util.logging)))
* TestRunEvent
* think about compatibility with old runners--no clashing class names
     
Cool ideas:
* TestProvider (useful when we have a command line?)
