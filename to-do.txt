Before first public release:
* update documentation
* add  javadoc to API interfaces and Annotations
* make sure TestListener is symmetric and meets needs of runner developers
	* TestRunEvent
* Event object for testListener.
* Decide how we ship JUnit-- 1.5 only or hybrid
* Stopping a test run (there was support for this in 3.8 - TestResult.shouldStop())

Before next JUnit 4 release:
* be able to run all tests simply from the command line
* get rid of JUnit4TestCaseAdapter (use JUnit4RunnerStrategy in JUnit4TestAdapter)
* update the build process
    * automatically upload a new JAR
* dynamically generated test cases
* make suites simpler for both the IDE providers and the users
* class level test annotations?
* Ant
	* Basic task
* enable tighter and more flexible IDE integration
	* enable test reordering/prioritization
	* test categorization & filtering (<- seems like a runner issue) @Category(short, integration)  @Test(category=windowsOnly)
* ParameterizedTest
* Suite annotation example:
	@Suite(tests={MoneyTest.class, SimpleTest.class})
	or with filters
	@Suite(pattern="*Test"}
	@Suite(package="org.junit.test.*")

	@Suite
* annotation for suite() method

* support testing run once initialization code e.g. class Foo {{...}}
