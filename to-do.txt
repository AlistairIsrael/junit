Vision: lower the barriers to entry and enable more sophisticated testing

Items
*	(separate VM for the runners)
*   annotation support
		no need to inherit from test case
			annotating test
			annotating setup/teardown
			annotating expected exceptions
*  use 1.5 features
		generify
		no longer use Vector
		use Enums, varargs, static imports, enhanced for
		compatibility with the assert keyword
*   support testing  run once initialization code
*	deprecate test suites
		need a way to describe collections of tests
*	compatbility with 3.8
		need a compatibility test suite
		add an ant compatbility
*	enable tighther and more flexible IDE integration
		enable test reordering/prioritization
			run failures first
*	dump the graphical runners
*  get 100% coverage
* 	logging support
* 	test listening (test run listener)
*     we should look into a test execution model which doesn't recquire
      that all test objects are instantiated during the test run.
      This might come hand in hand when revisiting the
      test suites
